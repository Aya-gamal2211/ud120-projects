### The words (features) and authors (labels), already largely processed.
### These files should have been created from the previous (Lesson 10)
### mini-project.
words_file = "../UD120-PROJECTS/tools/word_data.pkl"
authors_file = "../UD120-PROJECTS/tools/email_authors.pkl"
word_data = joblib.load( open(words_file , "r"))
authors = joblib.load( open(authors_file, "r") )



### test_size is the percentage of events assigned to the test set (the
### remainder go into training)
### feature matrices changed to dense representations for compatibility with
### classifier functions in versions 0.15.2 and earlier
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
features_train, features_test, labels_train, labels_test = train_test_split(word_data, authors, test_size=0.1, random_state=42)

from sklearn.feature_extraction.text import TfidfVectorizer
vectorizer = TfidfVectorizer(sublinear_tf=True, max_df=0.5, stop_words='english')
features_train = vectorizer.fit_transform(features_train)
features_test  = vectorizer.transform(features_test).toarray()


### a classic way to overfit is to use a small number
### of data points and a large number of features;
### train on only 150 events to put ourselves in this regime
features_train = features_train[:150].toarray()
labels_train   = labels_train[:150]



### your code goes here
reg = linear_model.Lasso()
reg.fit(features_train,labels_train)
pred=reg.predict(features_train)
print(reg.coef_)
